            <p class="lead">Version Control Systems, like Git, enables users to keep track of previous versions of a file or set of files.  It stores everything in a repository which can be accessed easily.  Each save contains when it was created, who made the changes to the file, and when the changes were made to the file.  They can be extremely useful when working on large projects with multiple people.  If a mistake is made, a user can just go back to a previously working version to either fix the problem or start over.  Version control systems are also inexpensive, so there is little excuse not to use one.</p>

            <p class="lead">Local version control systems store the different versions of such files directly to the user’s computer.  It cannot be accessed by others but is still useful if someone were to be working on a small project alone.  Local version control systems introduced a new way of keeping track of files, as the previous way consisted of just copying files into another directory, which could quickly get confusing and cause problems.  Many computers are equipped with rcs, a Version Control System Tool which helps keep track of differences between different files.</p>

            <p class="lead">In order to work with and keep track of changes when dealing with large projects with multiple people involved, Centralized Version Control Systems can be used.  This system stores all of the files being worked on onto one server, where users check files in and out to edit them.  They also allow administrators to only give certain access to certain people to prevent people from accidently altering or making mistakes in files that they do not need be messing with in the first place.  However, if the server were to go down, users would be unable to save or change any files during that time.

            </h2>
            <p class="lead">Distributed Version Control Systems fully mirrors the repository, which keeps backups of the file on all machines.  If a server were to stop working, back-ups on the user’s computer can be used to restore it.  This version gives users much more flexibility when working together on the same project.  It allows users to set up a variety of workflows.</p>

            <p class="lead">Git was created in 2005 in response to a rough relationships between the Linux community and the commercial company which created BitKeeper, which then began to charge for their product.  This led the Linux community to develop their over tool, now known as Git.  Since then, it has become a superior Version Control system that is extremely fast and efficient.  It is very useful when working on large projects.</p>
